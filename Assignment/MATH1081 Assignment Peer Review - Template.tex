    \textbf{Aspect 1:} Is the work written in sentences and paragraphs with correct grammar?

      \begin{itemize}
          \item Award 0 if there are no sentences.
          \item Award 1 if some parts are not written in sentences, the grammar is poor, or paragraphs are not used where appropriate.
          \item Award 2 if the work is written in sentences and paragraphs with correct grammar.

% ASPECT 2

\begin{tabular}{|m{37em}|}
    \hline
    
    \textbf{Aspect 2:} Is the level of written explanation sufficient for someone who did not know how to solve this problem to follow the argument? Are the explanations concise and clear? Do the explanations avoid unnecessary detail or irrelevant information?  
    \\ \hline
    
    \begin{tabular}{m{32em}|m{5em}}
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Award 0 if there is little or no explanation or very poor explanations.
          \item Award 1 if there is some explanation but it is not sufficient or unclear, or there is a lot of unnecessary material that obscures the argument.
          \item Award 2 if there is explanation sufficient for someone who did not know how to solve this problem to follow the argument and it is clear and concise.

% ASPECT 3

\begin{tabular}{|m{37em}|}
    \hline
    
    \textbf{Aspect 3:} Are the arguments self-contained and can they be understood without reference to the question? Are the conclusions written out clearly? Arguments can be made self-contained by copying the question but this must be re-typed and not simply an image. 
    \\ \hline
    
    \begin{tabular}{m{32em}|m{5em}}
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Award 0 if the arguments are not self-contained and there are no concluding statements.
          \item Award 1 if the arguments are self-contained or there are concluding statements but not both.
          \item Award 2 if the arguments are self-contained and the conclusions written out clearly.

    \\ \hline
    
    \begin{tabular}{m{32em}|m{5em}}
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Award 0 if there are serious errors of logic in more than one question.
          \item Award 1 if there are some invalid parts in the arguments but most arguments are sound.
          \item Award 2 if all answers are mathematically valid.

% ASPECT 5

\begin{tabular}{|m{37em}|}
    \hline
    
    \textbf{Aspect 5:} Are the equations typeset using an equation editor or similar? Are mathematical symbols within the text typeset as mathematical symbols? Are equations and mathematical expressions formatted appropriately?  
    \\ \hline
    
    \begin{tabular}{m{32em}|m{5em}}
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Award 0 if equations and mathematical symbols are not correctly typeset.
          \item Award 1 if some equations and mathematics symbols are correctly typeset but others are not or the formatting has significant flaws.
          \item Award 2 if all equations and almost all mathematical symbols are correctly typeset and the formatting is generally good.
